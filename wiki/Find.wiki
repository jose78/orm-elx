You must work with this method if you need to get a collection of entities with their relations (One to One or One to Much). the variable level inficates the depth in the driagram that you want, for example:

  * level = 0 of Company -> you get a collection of *TblCompany* without their relations.
  * level = 1 of Company -> you get a collection of *TblCompany* with their relations (Address , Employee).
  * level = 2 of Company -> you get a collection of *TblCompany* with their relations (Address , Employee-> Address).
