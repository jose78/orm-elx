= Find =

You must work with this method if you need to get a collection of entities with their relations (One to One or One to Much). You can indicate the depth of relations to get with *level*

{{{
	try {
		Integer level = 3;
		final Set<TblCompany> result = new Crud().find(TblCompany.class,
                                                                level,
                                                                new Criteria(" comp_id_company < ? " , 201).setPagination(1, 1)
                                                             );

	} catch (final Exception e) {
		log.error(e.getMessage(), e);
	}
