= ConnectionDef =

When Elx start to work, Elx scans the classpath to find all classes that they will use this annotation. With {{{@ConnectionDef}}} you can indicate:
  * The name of the connection.
  * If the connection is writable  and/or readable
  * By default, Elx use the class *org.elx.orm.db.SessionConncection* to  store the *ManagerConncection* in the thread, If you work with multi-  thread you must change this and to use your own method to manage the *ManagerConncection*.
