# Install & Dependencies #

In this moment Elx  is not available in the Maven's repositories so you would must download the jars from [here](http://code.google.com/p/orm-elx/downloads/list). To start to work, you must download this package:
  * Elx-commons
  * Elx-connector
  * Elx-validation
  * Elx-orm

In other hand, you must download de connector associated to the vendor of the DB

| Vendor | Connector |
|:-------|:----------|
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) |  Elx-connector-postgreSQL |
| [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) |   Elx-connector-mySQL |
| [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/) |   Elx-connector-derby  |

In the last point, Elx has dependencies with [scannotation](http://scannotation.sourceforge.net/)
