# `@Id` #

The annotation **@Id** in the attribute indicates that this attribute  is the id of the class. If you want that this value would be autogenerated with a sequence of the DB, you only need to indicate the connection and the name of sequence, obviously, when you work with many DB only one of them can be used to generate the ID.


```
              ......

        @Id(nameConnection = "CNX_TO_GENERATE_SEQ",sequenceName= "NAME_SEQ_TO_RUN")
        @Column(name = "emp_id_employee")
        private Long idEmployee;
        
              ......

```
