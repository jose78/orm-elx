# ELX #


Elx is an ORM not persistent. The basic idea it is to be simple, intuitive, easily extensible and strong, providing the following features:
  1. Multi-Database.
  1. Highly configurable.
  1. No configuration files.
  1. Only one entry point to work with the database.
  1. It uses a reduced number of annotations.
